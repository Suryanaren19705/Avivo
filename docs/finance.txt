Finance focuses on managing money, investments, and risk.

Credit risk refers to the probability that a borrower fails to repay a loan.
Loan default happens when repayments are missed for more than 90 days.

Banks use machine learning models like logistic regression and XGBoost for credit scoring.
Fraud detection identifies abnormal transaction behavior.

Interest rate represents the cost of borrowing money.
Higher credit risk usually results in higher interest rates.
